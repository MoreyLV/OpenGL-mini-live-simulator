# OpenGL mini live simulator

A tutorial project for learning modern OpenGL (3.3 Core) using SFML.
The project is being built from scratch with an emphasis on understanding the architecture rather than using ready-made engines.

The goal is to understand how:
- shaders
- meshes
- camera
- rendering
- separation of concerns between modules

---

## 📌 Implemented

- OpenGL context creation via SFML
- Loading OpenGL functions via GLAD
- Rendering and creation of an adjustable map (location) with the ability to edit map presets
- Custom Shader class
- Mesh class (VAO / VBO / attributes)
- Camera with orthographic projection
- Separation of logic:
- Rendering
- Events
- Utility
- Camera
- Minimal but clean architecture
